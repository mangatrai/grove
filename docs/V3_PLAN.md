# V3 Plan — Feature List with Priority

**Compiled:** 2026-05-08. Sources: `V3_BACKLOG.md`, `SECURITY_HARDENING_BACKLOG.md`, `EXPORT_IMPORT_BACKLOG.md`, `RECURRING_PAYMENTS_BACKLOG.md`, post-v2-merge change history, live onboarding sessions.

**Priority tiers:**
- **P1** — Bug or correctness issue; blocks trusted daily use or is a security risk
- **P2** — High-value feature; materially improves the app for regular use
- **P3** — Useful improvement; non-blocking, lower impact or more speculative
- **Deferred** — Explicitly post-V3; noted here for awareness

---

## P1 — Bugs & Correctness

### ~~B-1: Transfer ambiguity — confirm button missing after partial candidate dismissal~~ ✓ DELIVERED (FIX-168, 2026-05-10)
Confirm button never appeared because it required `creditId` (singular) in reason JSON but ingest always wrote `creditCandidateIds` (plural array).

**Delivered approach (simpler than originally planned):** Replaced the broken `creditId`-in-JSON confirm path entirely. Ingest now creates resolution items for the **debit only** (not all candidates). `buildResolutionItemRow` live-queries candidate transactions and returns `transferCandidates[]`. UI presents a radio picker — user selects the correct credit, clicks "Confirm transfer pair". One confirm button per item regardless of candidate count. Bulk confirm removed (dead after this redesign). Legacy credit-side items handled gracefully (self-referential candidates filtered out).

---

### ~~B-2: Dismissed transfer items re-surface on every new import~~ ✓ DELIVERED (FIX-168, 2026-05-10)
Canonical row had no memory of the dismissal decision.

**Delivered:** Migration 0040 adds `transfer_excluded BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE` to `transaction_canonical`. Dismiss path (`updateResolutionStatusForHousehold` + bulk) sets `transfer_excluded = TRUE` on the debit row. Ingest candidate query adds `AND NOT transfer_excluded`. Note: "re-include as transfer candidate" action not implemented (deferred — uncommon edge case).

---

### ~~B-3: Multi-day same-amount transfers create cross-match ambiguity~~ ✓ DELIVERED (FIX-168, 2026-05-10)
Two same-amount transfers on consecutive days each claimed the same two credit candidates.

**Delivered approach (simpler than originally planned):** No greedy algorithm. The debit-only resolution item model solves this naturally — each debit gets its own item with the full candidate list, and the radio picker lets the user assign the correct credit. First debit to confirm claims the credit; the other debit's item shows "no candidates" on next load. "Dissolve transfer pair" action not implemented (deferred).

---

### ~~B-4: Marcus PDF parser — ACH deposits silently dropped~~ ✓ DELIVERED (FIX-160, 2026-05-08)
ACH deposits with wrapped description text are lost. Only single-line entries (Interest Paid) parse correctly. Root cause: `pdf-parse` doesn't understand columnar layout — description wrapping interleaves with amount columns.

**Fix:** `pendingLine` state machine accumulates date+description lines until ≥2 dollar amounts arrive on a continuation line, then joins and parses. Pre-scan pass extracts Beginning/Ending Balance and Statement Period from the summary block above ACCOUNT ACTIVITY.

**Files:** `backend/src/modules/imports/profiles/marcus-online-savings-pdf.ts`, `backend/tests/pdf-parsers.test.ts`

---

### ~~B-5: Import "Belongs To" not auto-set when account is selected~~ ✓ DELIVERED (FIX-158, 2026-05-08)
`onAccountChange` reads `ownerScope` from draft state instead of from the selected account object. OFX auto-detect has the same bug (uses role-based logic, ignores account's own `owner_scope`).

**Fix (frontend-only, already fully diagnosed):** In `onAccountChange` at all three branches (~lines 771, 803, 826) and the OFX auto-bind block (~line 495): read `account.owner_scope` / `account.owner_person_profile_id` first; fall back to draft.

**Files:** `frontend/src/pages/ImportWorkspacePage.tsx`

---

### ~~B-6: Transactions page — incomplete Mantine migration + non-clickable subcategory picker~~ ✓ DELIVERED (FIX-159, 2026-05-08)
Category picker still uses custom CSS. Group/sub-group alert uses custom class. In Needs Review tab, "Add subcategory" is not clickable (z-index / pointer-events / focus-trap bug from partial migration).

**Fix:** Complete Mantine migration on TransactionsPage (category picker → Mantine `Select`/`Combobox`, alert → Mantine `Alert`). Diagnose and fix the non-clickable subcategory picker in Needs Review.

**Files:** `frontend/src/pages/TransactionsPage.tsx`

---

### ~~B-7 (Security P1): AI insight cooldown — in-memory → DB-backed~~ ✓ DELIVERED (FIX-164, 2026-05-09)
Rate-limit `Map<householdId, timestamp>` resets on every process restart. Allows unbounded API cost on frequent restarts.

**Fix:** `insight_job` table already existed. Replaced Map with a query for the most recent `created_at` for the household; remaining cooldown computed from that. No migration needed.

**Files:** `backend/src/modules/insights/insights.routes.ts`

---

## P2 — High-Value Features

### ~~F-1: Account enrichment — memo, sub_type, liquidity~~ ✓ DELIVERED (CR-169, 2026-05-10)

**Delivered (expanded from original plan):**
- `sub_type TEXT` — comprehensive two-level hierarchy (9 top-level types × up to 13 subtypes). New types added: `health` (HSA/FSA/HRA/ABLE) and `education` (529/Coverdell/UGMA-UTMA). `mortgage` top-level type removed — now `loan/mortgage_primary|investment|vacation`.
- `memo TEXT` — free-form note fed to AI insights
- `liquidity TEXT CHECK('liquid','semi_liquid','restricted')` — `defaultLiquidity()` auto-sets from type+subtype at save; user can override. Correct edge cases: savings/cd → semi_liquid; investment/stock_options → restricted; health/hsa → semi_liquid.
- `linked_account_id TEXT FK → financial_account(id)` — self-referential, wired for future HELOC→mortgage pairing
- `property_id TEXT FK → property(id)` — links mortgage accounts to property entity (see F-2)
- **UI:** flat `Select` replaced with `HierarchicalSearchPicker` (type → subtype two-pane picker); memo `Textarea`; liquidity override `Select` (clearable, auto label when empty)
- **Data migration:** existing `mortgage` rows → `type='loan', sub_type='mortgage_primary'`
- `balance-sheet.service.ts` + `insight-prompt.service.ts` updated: `health`/`education` classified as assets; `mortgage` references removed

**Files:** `backend/db/migrations/0041_v3_account_enrichment.sql`, `backend/src/modules/imports/import-file-binding.service.ts`, `backend/src/modules/imports/imports.routes.ts`, `backend/src/modules/reports/balance-sheet.service.ts`, `backend/src/modules/insights/insight-prompt.service.ts`, `frontend/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`, `frontend/src/pages/NetWorthPage.tsx`, `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPageV2.tsx`

---

### ~~F-2: Real estate account type + home equity display~~ ✓ DELIVERED (structural, CR-169, 2026-05-10)

**Delivered approach (simpler than originally planned — no `real_estate` account type):**

Original plan added a `real_estate` account type, which created an institution identity problem (no bank = no natural institution). Revised design: property data lives on a dedicated `property` table linked to the mortgage account via FK. No separate asset account needed.

- **`property` table:** `address_line1`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, `country`, `property_use` (`primary`/`rental`/`vacation`), `api_provider`, `api_property_id` (for future valuation API)
- **`property_value_snapshot` table:** time-series market values — mirrors `account_balance_snapshot` pattern. Unique index on `(property_id, as_of_date)`. Upserts on same date rather than creating duplicates.
- **Backend:** `property.service.ts` (new) — full CRUD + value snapshot CRUD. Routes at `GET/POST /household/properties`, `GET/PATCH /household/properties/:id`, `GET/POST /household/properties/:id/values`
- **UI:** mortgage accounts in Settings table show a `+ Property` / `Property` button opening a modal with address fields + market value entry. Value creates first snapshot in the time series.

**Not yet implemented (remaining F-2 work):**
- Net worth equity callout (`Primary Residence → Mortgage → Equity` display in `NetWorthPage.tsx`) — property data is stored, backend query needs to join and surface it
- Property value history chart (expand-on-click, same pattern as F-4 per-account chart)
- Real estate auto-valuation API integration (deferred → D-2)

**Files:** `backend/db/migrations/0041_v3_account_enrichment.sql`, `backend/src/modules/household/property.service.ts` (new), `backend/src/modules/household/household.routes.ts`, `frontend/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`

---

### F-3: Net worth — liquidity breakdown
Adds a liquidity tier summary beneath the net worth total:
```
Net Worth:     $XXX,XXX
  Liquid:       $XX,XXX   (checking, savings)
  Semi-liquid:  $XX,XXX   (brokerage — days to settle)
  Restricted:   $XX,XXX   (retirement, HSA, 529, real estate)
  Liabilities: -$XX,XXX
```
Computed from `liquidity` field on `financial_account` (F-1 prerequisite). Accounts with no `liquidity` set fall into an "Uncategorized" bucket to prompt tagging.

**Files:** `balance-sheet.service.ts`, `NetWorthPage.tsx`

---

### ~~F-4: Net worth — per-account balance history chart (expand-on-click)~~ ✓ DELIVERED (CR-161, 2026-05-09)
Click an account row in the net worth table → inline expand reveals a Recharts LineChart of that account's balance over time. Backend API (`GET /reports/balance-sheet/history?accountIds=X`) already fully built. Frontend-only feature.

Edge cases: 1-2 snapshots → flat line or placeholder; 0 snapshots → no expand offered.

**Files:** `frontend/src/pages/NetWorthPage.tsx`

---

### F-5: Payslip deposit matching — stored pairing + improved matching logic
Current dynamic-only model loses the confirmed match on every load; flaky for edge cases (split deposits, late ACH, null pay_date).

**Hybrid model:**
1. Dynamic candidates shown as suggestions (existing behavior)
2. "Confirm" button on a candidate → writes `matched_deposit_canonical_id` on `payslip_snapshot` row
3. Subsequent loads use stored match (no re-query); "Unlink" clears it
4. Manual pick: search/select any transaction from ledger (handles split deposits)

**Matching improvements:**
- Date window: ±5 business days instead of ±3 calendar days
- Split deposit support: if no single match, look for same-day credits summing to net pay
- `pay_date` null fallback: use `pay_period_end` ± wider window
- Surface confidence to user (date distance, amount delta)

**DB:** New migration adding `matched_deposit_canonical_id TEXT REFERENCES transaction_canonical(id) ON DELETE SET NULL` to `payslip_snapshot`.

**Files:** `payslip.service.ts`, new migration, `payslip.routes.ts` (PATCH confirm/unlink), `PayslipDetailPage.tsx`

---

### ~~F-6: Async payslip upload (fix 504 on OpenAI calls)~~ → moved to P3 (see I-2)
The import session flow is already async and stateful. The 504 risk on IBM payslip upload is real but has not surfaced as an active problem in practice. Deprioritised in favour of higher-value P2 features. The fix pattern (202/poll using the existing export_job model) is documented in I-2 alongside the import parse/canonicalize case and can be implemented together when the time comes.

---

### F-7: AI insights — fix transfer and flow pollution in spending data
Two gaps in `insight-prompt.service.ts` make LLM spending figures unreliable:
1. Transfer-categorized transactions without `transfer_group_id` pass the `IS NULL` filter and appear in topCategories
2. Credit card payments (checking → credit card) double-count as both outflow and inflow

**Fixes:**
- Add `AND NOT (COALESCE(p.name, c.name) ILIKE '%transfer%')` filter to `topSpendCategories12m` and `flowTotals12m`
- Filter Uncategorized from `topCategories` (move to separate `uncategorizedMonthlyAvg` field)
- Add `dataNote` annotation to LLM prompt context explaining what was excluded

**Bonus (flow classification):** Map top-level category names to flow classes (`true_income`, `lifestyle`, `wealth_building`, `tax`, `movement`). Split `avgMonthlyOutflow` into `lifestyleSpend`, `wealthBuilding`, `taxObligations`, `moneyMovements`. Annotate LLM prompt with separate fields. No schema change needed — category names are the signal. ⚠ Keep compute simple: lookup map at query time only.

**Files:** `insight-prompt.service.ts`

---

### F-8: Money flow classification in reports (cash summary + budget)
Extend flow classification (F-7) from AI insights to the app's own reports:

**Cash Summary:** Split outflow into `lifestyleSpend` / `wealthBuilding` / `taxObligations` / `moneyMovements`. Compute savings rate on lifestyle only (not total outflow). Split inflow into `trueIncome` / `moneyReturns`.

**Budget page:** Suppress budget progress bars for non-lifestyle categories. Show investment contributions, loans, taxes in a separate "Movements" section or hide from budget overage report.

**⚠ Groom before implementing:** 0.25 vCPU constraint. Solution must be a lookup map on category names at query time. No materialised views, no background jobs, no new tables. Design-review this item before writing code.

**Files:** `cash-summary.service.ts`, `budget.service.ts`, `DashboardPageV2.tsx`, `BudgetPage.tsx`

---

### F-9: Date of birth — encrypted at rest, computed age
`person_profile.age` is a manually-entered integer the user must update every year. Store encrypted DOB instead; compute age automatically.

**Schema:** Add `date_of_birth_encrypted TEXT` to `person_profile`. Keep `age INTEGER` as nullable fallback for profiles without DOB. API never returns raw DOB — only `hasDob: boolean` and computed `age: number | null`.

**Encryption:** AES-256-GCM, same pattern as `gdrive.service.ts`. Key derived from `JWT_SECRET` via `crypto.scryptSync`. Format: `base64(iv[12] + authTag[16] + ciphertext)`.

**UI:** Date picker in profile edit. Age field becomes read-only + auto-computed once DOB is set. Clear DOB returns to manual age input.

**Export:** DOB excluded from `.hfb` exports (PII encrypted with instance-specific key). Restore completion notice should say: "Date of birth for each person must be re-entered."

**Files:** `household.service.ts`, `insight-prompt.service.ts`, new migration, profile settings UI

---

## P3 — Useful Improvements

### I-1: Personal loan tracker
`loan_event` entity groups related lent/repaid transactions under a named event. Outstanding balance optionally surfaced as informal receivable on net worth.

**Schema:** `loan_event` + `loan_event_transaction` join table (see V3_BACKLOG.md for full design).

**Net worth integration:** Open loan events shown as "Informal Receivables" asset row (user-configurable include/exclude per event).

**AI insights integration:** Transactions tagged to a loan event excluded from lifestyle spending totals; separate `informalLoans` block sent to LLM.

**Priority note:** Category workaround (`Loans > Personal` out, `Income > Reimbursements` in) is viable for now. Build after F-8 flow classification is shipped.

---

### I-2: Async payslip upload + import parse/canonicalize (504 resilience)
Apply the existing 202/poll pattern (proven in export/restore) to the remaining synchronous long-running operations:
- `POST /payslips/upload` (IBM path) — awaits OpenAI synchronously; 504 risk on slow responses
- `POST /imports/sessions/:id/parse` → 202 + jobId
- `POST /imports/sessions/:id/canonicalize` → 202 + jobId

Import session state machine already handles in-progress state; frontend polls session status naturally. Implement together as a single pass when 504s become a live issue.

**Files:** `payslip.routes.ts`, `payslip-parse.service.ts`, `import-session.service.ts`, `import-parser.service.ts`, new job migration

---

### I-3: Category / reimbursement taxonomy cleanup
- Rename or restructure `Income > Reimbursements`: the "Income" parent is misleading. Consider top-level `Reimbursements & Recoveries` category, classified as `money_return` flow class (not `true_income`).
- Audit global rules: remove/narrow any rule mapping payment methods (Zelle, Venmo, PayPal, CashApp) → Reimbursements. These are too broad.
- Groom alongside F-8 (flow classification) — categories must align with flow class map.

**Files:** `backend/db/seeds/`, category service, potentially new migration to rename global builtin category

---

### I-4: Security — password reset token cleanup
`createPasswordResetToken` deletes *unused* tokens for user before insert. Used/expired tokens are never purged — slow table growth over time.

**Fix:** Add periodic cleanup (inside `purgeExpiredExports` or separate cron):
`DELETE FROM password_reset_token WHERE used_at IS NOT NULL OR expires_at < NOW()`

**Files:** `auth.service.ts`

---

### I-5: Export/restore housekeeping
Two small items from `EXPORT_IMPORT_BACKLOG.md`:
- **Restore staging file not deleted:** Add `fs.unlink(storagePath)` in `finally` block of `runImportJob` after job completion/failure (mirrors `runBackupJob` which already does this).
- **Restore completion UI:** Warn user that GDrive connection is lost after restore (expected — `household_gdrive_config` excluded from `.hfb`). Add notice to restore success message: "Settings → Data → Reconnect Google Drive."

**Files:** `import-household-bundle.service.ts`, restore success UI

---

### I-6: Drive query string escaping
`folderId` interpolated directly into Drive API `q` parameter. DB-sourced so low exploitability, but add guard:
`if (!/^[\w-]+$/.test(folderId)) throw new Error(...)`

**Files:** `gdrive-backup.service.ts`

---

### I-8: Playwright end-to-end test suite exploration
The app has 400+ backend integration tests (Vitest + supertest) but no browser-level test coverage. UI bugs like the ones found in V3 (broken subcategory picker, delta cards, broken expand chart) would be caught earlier with E2E tests that drive a real browser.

**Scope for exploration:**
- Evaluate [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) (Microsoft, TypeScript-native, supports Chromium/Firefox/WebKit, built-in trace viewer)
- Spike: auth flow, import session creation, ledger category assignment, net worth balance entry
- Decision point: how to handle local Postgres setup (reuse Docker Compose) and whether to run in CI or locally only
- Timebox to a spike — full coverage is a multi-sprint effort; the goal is proving out the framework and toolchain before committing

**Why P3 (not deferred):** Reliability gap is visible in V3. Worth scheduling once P1/P2 are stable rather than post-V3.

---

### UX-166: Consistent currency display — comma-separated thousands everywhere
All dollar values displayed in the app use inconsistent formatting today. `NetWorthPage` already uses `toLocaleString()` (commas present); `PayslipsPage`, `DashboardPageV2`, `ImportWorkspacePage`, `SettingsPage` use raw `toFixed(2)` with no comma separator (e.g. `7305.84` instead of `7,305.84`).

**Fix:** Create a shared `formatUsd(n: number): string` utility (using `toLocaleString('en-US', { minimumFractionDigits: 2, maximumFractionDigits: 2 })`). Replace all bare `toFixed(2)` dollar-value calls across ~8 files. Chart tick/tooltip formatters updated in the same pass.

**Note:** Non-dollar `toFixed` calls (KB file sizes, confidence scores, priority values, tolerance percentages) are intentionally excluded.

**Files:** New `frontend/src/utils/format.ts`, `PayslipsPage.tsx`, `DashboardPageV2.tsx`, `ImportWorkspacePage.tsx`, `SettingsPage.tsx`, `PayslipIncomeCharts.tsx`, `PayslipDetailPage.tsx`, `PayslipManualPage.tsx`

---

### UX-167: Cash register input — decimal-first dollar entry
Dollar amount inputs across the app require the user to manually type the decimal point. A fat-finger omission (typing `1002` when intending `100.20`) silently submits the wrong value.

**Fix:** Add `react-currency-input-field` (battle-tested, TypeScript-native, zero custom hook work). Create a thin `CurrencyInput` wrapper that applies Mantine styling. Cash-register behavior (right-to-left digit shifting, always 2 decimal places) comes from the library config — `decimalsLimit={2}` + `fixedDecimalLength={2}`.

**Scope:** Apply only to dollar-value inputs. Excluded: priority, confidence, tolerance percentage, file size, and other non-dollar numeric fields.

**Dollar inputs to update:** manual balance entry (NetWorthPage), salary / initial balance fields (SettingsPage ~5 instances), budget amounts (BudgetPage), payslip manual entry (PayslipManualPage), manual transaction amount (TransactionsPage).

**Prereq:** UX-166 (do in same pass — same files touched).

**Files:** `react-currency-input-field` (new dep), new `frontend/src/components/CurrencyInput.tsx`, `NetWorthPage.tsx`, `SettingsPage.tsx`, `BudgetPage.tsx`, `PayslipManualPage.tsx`, `TransactionsPage.tsx`

---

### I-7: Recurring payments — remaining backlog (Phases 4+)
Phases 1–3 shipped (CR-121/122/123). Remaining deferred items:
- **Annual subscription detection:** Current CV + 2-month gate misses annual charges. Detect single-annual-charge pattern separately.
- **Upcoming bill prediction:** Use confirmed recurring overrides to predict next charge date/amount.
- **Per-transaction exclusion:** Exclude a specific transaction from a confirmed recurring pattern (one-time same-merchant charge).

These are enhancements to the shipped recurring system, not blockers.

---

## Post-V3 (Deferred)

### D-1: Data archival + pre-computed monthly reports
Pre-compute and store `monthly_report` rows at month close. Raw data retention policy (user-configurable window). Enables long-term trend analysis without full-table scans; reduces DB footprint over time.

**Why deferred:** Foundational reporting (F-7/F-8 flow classification) must come first. This is infrastructure that only pays off at 2+ years of data. Design the report schema with archival in mind from the start; don't implement yet.

---

### D-2: Real estate auto-valuation (market value API)
Monthly background job fetches `account_balance_snapshot` from RealtyAPI / FreeWebAPI using stored `property_api_id`. Requires `REALTY_API_KEY` env var; degrades to manual if absent.

**Why deferred:** Manual entry covers the use case for v3. API integration is nice-to-have; property values don't move meaningfully month-to-month.

---

### D-3: Rental income tracking
Link rent deposits to a rental property account; track expenses (HOA, maintenance), compute ROI. Significant feature thread — v4 candidate. Do not block F-2 (real estate account type) on this.

---

### D-4: Multi-household
Email as canonical identity; `user_household_membership` join table. Fully deferred. Design in `docs/MULTI_HOUSEHOLD_BACKLOG.md`.

---

### D-5: HELOC modeling
Home equity line of credit — hybrid liability. Tentative: `type: credit_card` + `linked_account_id → real_estate`. Needs more design thought before implementation.
